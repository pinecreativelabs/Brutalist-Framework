	<h3 class="flow-text"><strong>Getting Started</strong></h3>
	<div class="flex"><div class="half padded">
		<p><strong>MARKUP.</strong><br />PolyGrids are Flexbox items arranged in a row. Use the following markup:</p>
		<p class="padded terminal">
			&lt;div class="polygrid <em>SHAPE SIZE</em>"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="shape"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;..content..<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />&lt;/div&gt;
		</p>
		<p>Where <em>SHAPE</em> and <em>SIZE</em> are a shape and size class.</p>
	</div><div class="half padded">
		<p><strong>REQUIRED SCRIPT.</strong><br />The following javascript is required and needs to be placed before the closing <em>body</em> tag:</p>
		<p class="padded warning"><strong>core/jab/poly-grid.js</strong></p>
		<p>The javascript automatically inserts the necessary shape elements that will be floated left and right within each shape grid item.</p>
	</div></div>
	<hr />
	<h3 class="flow-text"><strong>Constructing Grids</strong></h3>
	<div class="flex"><div class="half padded">
		<p><strong>SIZES.</strong><br />Grid shape items have pre-defined widths and heights that are proportionate to the <strong>height</strong> of the viewport. For example, if we want shape items to occupy 25% of the height of the screen, we would apply the class <em>fourths</em>. Use any of the following size classes:</p>
		<p class="padded info"><strong>.sixths</strong> - 16.5% (1/6) height<br />
		<strong>.fifths</strong> - 20% (1/5) height<br /><strong>.fourths</strong> - 25% (1/4) height<br />
		<strong>.thirds</strong> - 33% (1/3) height<br /><strong>.halves</strong> - 50% (1/2) height<br />
	</div><div class="half padded">
		<p><strong>SHAPES</strong><br />Use any of the following shape classes:</p>
		<p class="padded info"><strong>.circle<br />.triangle<br />.rhombus<br />.hexagon<br />.octagon<br />.plus<br />.hourglass<br />.chevron</strong></p>
	</div></div>
	<hr />
	<h3 class="flow-text"><strong>Additional Options</strong></h3>
	<div class="flex"><div class="half padded">
		<p><strong>GAPS.</strong><br />Gap spacing can be added between items for several shape grids. Simply add the class <em><strong>gaps</strong></em> to the polygrid wrapper. In the example below, we have applly gaps to a sixth triangle polygrid:<br /><br /><strong>.gaps</strong>.polygrid triangle.sixths</p>
		<div class="polygrid packed triangle sixths gaps">
			<div class="shape">1</div>
			<div class="shape">2</div>
			<div class="shape">3</div>
			<div class="shape">4</div>
		</div>
	</div><div class="padded half">
		<p><strong>REVERSE.</strong><br />We can reverse the flow of grid items from last to first by applying the class <em><strong>reverse</strong></em>. In the example below, we have a reversed packed triangle grid:<br /><br /><strong>.reverse</strong>.polygrid.triangle.packed.sixths.gaps</p>
		<div class="polygrid reverse packed triangle sixths gaps">
			<div class="shape">1</div>
			<div class="shape">2</div>
