						<p class="charcoal-text lucida-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat" class="blue-text lime invert-hover" target="_blank">Samizdat</a> was an underground publishing technique deployed by dissedents in the Eastern Bloc who lived under the Soviet regime. The word comes from the Russian "sam" for self and "izdat" for publishing house.Samizdat Journalists and poets face persecution and death for their efforts</p>
            
              <p class="charcoal-text lucida-text"><a href="https://indieweb.org/academic_samizdat" class="blue-text lime invert-hover" target="_blank">Academic Samizdat</a> takes the dissident spirit to break the chains of opression that the publishing industry and the ivory tower have forced upon scholars. Too few sit at the top throwing scraps to us peasents. Time to reclaim our research identity.

						<p class="charcoal-text lucida-text" style="margin-top: 0.8em;">The Samizdat Journal of Blogging amd Social Media research takes an <strong>anti-conventional</strong> approach to copyright. We never want rights to your articles. In fcat our system is set up where all manuscript subscriptions, revisions, and drafting happen on your own website. Once finished a syndicated copy of your research will live here and on your website</p>

						<h3 class="courier-new-text red-text bold">Want to Publish in Samizdat: Journal of Blogging and Social Media Research?</h3>
						<ul class="square inside charcoal-text" style="margin-right: 1.1em;">
							<li><span class="heavy">Have a website</span>All of your drafts and revisions will not occur here. You will own every step of the writing process. The only data we store are the reviews and a syndicated copy of the final draft. While your own domain is ideal you can use common writing platforms like Blogger, Medium, Wordpress.com. If you do not have a site, no worries. Contact the editorial board. We are happy to help you carve out independence online.</li>
							<li><span class="heavy">Respond to Call For Proposal</span>Samizdat Journal of Blogging and Social Media Research accepts empirical research, well timed rants, qualitative methods as fake as positivist numbers, and poetry...always acept poetry..it's bad mojo otherwise. Specifically a wide range of formats and methodologies are accepted, including qualitative research, quantitative studies, narrative research, single case studies, ethnography, content analysis, discourse analysis, surveys, experiments, mixed methods research, conceptual and theoretical pieces. You are encouraged to make up your own methods as long as they are reproducible and ethical.</li>
							<li><span class="heavy">Open Peer Review</span> We do not believe in the false scarcity created on the education publishing industry. Impact ratings are tools of the opressors that funnel much needed education dollars into the cloisters of the privledged few. Instead we seek to mentor research pieces towards publications and have no problem with you publishign the finished piece elsewhere to advance your career. We are in it for the knowledge and learning. Our reviewers start with the question, "How much coaching will it take to bring this piece ready to publication." No one should brag about high rejection rates. Drafts we advance for publication include:
                <ul>
                <li>Ethical research</li>
                <li>Justified methodologies or reasoning</li>
                <li>Make big glaims by asking tough questions</li>
                  <li>Utilize affordances of multimodal texts</li>
                </ul></li>
							<li><span class="heavy">Syndication</span> We encourage you to publish work here that has been published elsewhere. Self-plagirism is a myth designed to protect copyright holders. Why shouldn't we disseminate our work widely? Why is it bad to copy our own words and thoughts? To stop the wider spread of knowledge? You must respect any previous copyright that shackles your work, but we WANT you to publish your articles elsewhere and WILL publish articles you have posted.</li>

						<h3 class="courier-new-text red-text bold">Supporting not Rejecting Scholarshsip</h3>
						<p class="charcoal-text lucida-text">As stated we use an <em>Open Peer Review Process</em>.</p>
						
						<p>All reviews are openly released by the editorial board. However individual authors have the right to determine if these open comments are dsiplayed. They can choose to show comments on their drafts, hide them or delete them. A reviewer will follow the respect of an author. Meaning if an author makes feedback private we will make our copy of the feedback provate as well. </p>
            <p>
              When a piece is recieved it is reviewed using a holistic five point scale rubric based on theory, methods, organization, impact and style. You are not rated but the scale is used to identify how much facilitation and peer review it will take to get a piece ready for publication. The data also helps the editors match a piece to reviewers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We seek to see every piece publish yet we will reject any peice where we feel the methods are fraudulent, copyrighted material was used in a way the author knows is unethical, or the research and data collection was don in unethical ways. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Once your piece is reviewed facilitators will be assigned. These are usually the same reviewers as we match reviewers to topics. The facilitators will then use the reviewer comments and post specific suggestions for you to address.
