## About
_Brutalist Framework_ is a responsive framework exclusively for the popular brutalist web design trend. It is intended to be a boilerplate for creating simple brutalist websites.

* Cynically confrontational
* Roughly raw and rugged
* Uncomfortably ugly and unpolished
* Deliberately daring and damaging
* Extremely exasperated and embittered
